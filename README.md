# Notes
You have to put the input tag as a sibling element of the element you want to transform.
It doesn't matter where in your code you put your input, because you can click the label to check and uncheck it (and it will have `display: hidden` anyway.

So put your label where you need to click, and the input tag as a parent element of the one you need to transform. Use ~ tag to select the sibling element.
